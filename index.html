            If you are reading this blog, well it's my first blog and I'm glad
            you're here! <br />
            We all have experienced bugs in our life - I mean programming bugs.
            (The other ones are nice except for a few). These programming bugs
            are hell deadly coz they not only affect a li'l bit of program which
            you've written but also you're mental health - well we go into
            various head-scratching moment where we pray to god(if you're an
            atheist.... well look for yourselves). What is a bug in programming
            - well bugs are like elusive clowns, hiding in the shadows and
            popping up when you least expect them, ready to give you a good
            laugh (or cry) as you desperately try to catch them. These range
            from a simple typo in your code where you wrote max as a variable
            and wondering why the heck the function is not working to the
            programmers most formidable enemy - 'The segmentation fault' . If
            you encounter this in C ... RIP my friend. <br />
            But on the brighter side- we have various debugging tools like gdb -
            GNU Debugger and Valgrind (the grind part is true *_*) which are the
            saviours - if and only if you know how to use them. But its the best
            part is when you find the bug and your program starts working (as it
            should) , the level of dopamine release is exhilarating and you
            imagine yourself as the king of world but soon do you realize
            there's another bug and you enter the state of grief. See here you
            need a coffee break - now you have your coffee - you come back and
            this process of finding bugs continue untill the software gets
            outdated and a newer version is released, but damn this also
            contains bugs - so it's a never ending cycle of bug finding and
            fixing!
